## [PuntAnalytics website](http://puntanalytics.nl)
This repo hosts the website of my company (**KVK:** 93933886) "Punt Analytics & Webapp Development" using GitHub Pages. The domain is configured by [Xel](https://www.xel.nl/). GitHub Pages is used since changes to the website are automatically reflected in the website when they are committed.

#### Goal of company
My company provides bespoke static websites and/or interactive dashboards that visualise simple (!) datasets, such as those presented in an Excel spreadsheet. My goal is to develop a visually consistent landing page for the client who is interested in either showcasing their brand or allowing people to interact with some data, for example in the form of a simple calculator. By turning an Excel spreadsheet into an online dashboard, it can be accessed from any device that can browse the internet, including mobile devices.

#### How our webapps & websites are developed
For example, you might want to visualise a spreadsheet you have been working on and provide consistent and clean online access to it. To do this, we use the Python frameworks [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and [Dash](https://plotly.com/examples/dashboards/), on which websites such as LinkedIn and Pinterest are based. These frameworks are fully open to commercial use. This means you are free to use our in-house web applications for any purpose, both non-profit and for-profit. We also offer more 'traditional' web development frameworks such as HTML and CSS if a simpler landing page is preferred. 

The way we host our web applications means that we can link them to a [custom domain](https://www.koyeb.com/docs/run-and-scale/domains), which could be part of a website URL that you already own. For example, if you own the domain ```www.mycompany.com```, we could configure the web application to be accessible from ```wwww.webapp.mycompany.com```. We don't need access to the source files of your website as everything is done via DNS redirection, which can be easily implemented by your domain hosting service. The sample web applications you can find on my website are hosted in this way. For normal websites, we can also handle domain registration and hosting for you. That means you don't need to worry about anything. 

### What we offer
- Development of static company landing pages tailored to your needs for a **fixed** fee. With Punt Analytics, you won't run into unexpected development costs and we will always describe the features to be implemented in detail before quoting you a price. 
- If required, hosting and domain registration of your website. 
- Development of dynamic web applications with a unique visual style that can visualise and store data flows + edits for a **fixed** fee, i.e. you always pay a fixed fee for the requested features, regardless of how much time we spend. You will own the code, i.e. other parties will never have access to the source code of your web application. Note that static websites built in HTML and CSS can always be read publicly by anyone viewing them! This makes Python a very attractive choice for web development. 
- Web application maintenance support. Security and stability updates are free for 2 years (we ensure that the software is always running on the latest stable, supported version). Additional features can be implemented for a fee (subsequently charged per hour of work). 

Note: [puntanalytics.nl](puntanalytics.nl) is based on the 'minimal' theme by [Templatecookie](https://templatecookie.com).
